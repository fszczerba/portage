		Night Light IRC Bouncer/Proxy (ircproxy) is an advanced multi-user IRC
		bouncer written in C with IPv6 and SSL support.
		
		It can proxy simultaneous users at the same time to different IRC
		servers.
		
		The IRC connection can stay connected to IRC when the IRC client
		disconnects, the user can then later reattach to the same IRC
		connection.

		Private messages and channel activity can an be logged when no IRC
		clients are attached. You can then see what you have been missing while
		you're offline.

		It is also possible to attach multiple IRC clients on the same IRC
		connection. This is useful if you want to be connected from home and
		work at the same time without cloning.
